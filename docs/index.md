# How to run documentation?
1. Open command prompt
2. Move to Docs/mkdocs/api-docs
3. mkdocs serve

If this does not work:

1. pip install mkdocs
2. mkdocs serve

If it still does not work you may have to make a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) and run pip install mkdocs in there followed by mkdocs serve
